_Blackjack, on its surface, is a simple game. The goal: get as close to 21 as possible
without going over._ 

Simple enough, right? In reality, there is a lot more to consider. The number of decks, payouts, doubling rules, shuffling methods, and many other factors contribute to the house edge, the minimum advantage the dealer has over the player. These advantages are calculated assuming play by basic strategy, a guide for moves based solely on probability. Unfortunately, even in the best case scenario and strict basic strategy, the house holds a slight advantage. This means no matter how skilled or lucky you think you are, the house will win eventually. However, the minor house advantage can be reversed using the difficult technique known as counting cards (which although casinos frown upon, is legal). The best counters can supplement the probabilities that determine basic strategy based on the contents of the discard pile to give the player a slight (0.5 - 1 %) advantage.

This application is a simulation of both strategies: basic and counting cards. Here, you can see how they work in action, as well as how they (and other game variables) impact the house edge. With proper play and a little luck, maybe you can hear those magic words: [__WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!__](http://modernnotion.com/say-winner-winner-chicken-dinner/)
