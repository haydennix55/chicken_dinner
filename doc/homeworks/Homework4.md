# Homework 4
#### 3/23/18

   1. What I Planned On Doing

      For this checkpoint, I would like to have all the game functionality of blackjack working. This would be any part of the code that would be required to play a game if this was an application to do so. It should be able to play rounds (without strategy).


   2. What I Actually Accomplished

      I did it! I successfully completed all the necessary game functionalities required to play the game of blackjack. In addition, in order to have more of a deliverable, I added in print statements and user inputs in order to allow you to actually play it. I never planned on doing this, as they were just going to be simulated games and demonstrations, but it should just be simply changing the user making the choices to a computer decided strategy algorithm making the decisions.

      What I Didn't Do: There are a few things that are casino/table dependent that I did not yet implement. This includes insurance (when the dealer is showing an Ace), splitting, the shuffle card, and only allowing doubles on two card hands. I will likely add these later as they do impact the house edge, but they are not necessary components of the game.

   3. Next Deadline

        a. What I Had Planned

        * For this checkpoint, I would like to have the house edge calculator completed. This will involve creating game variables and having the basic strategy probability implemented. At this point, I should be able to run a round where the code plays by basic strategy, as well as determine the house edge given different game variables and basic strategy (a strategy must be implemented to know the house edge).

        b. Changes

        * Given that the time between HW4 and final project checkpoint 1 is shorter than I had anticipated, I will revise what I plan on doing. Rather than implement the house edge calculator, which will require many extraneous game variables and a GUI or user interaction, I plan on finishing the big picture part of my original plan for the checkpoint: Basic Strategy. I will have an algorithm written to determine how to act according to probability and have the application able to play rounds by itself using basic strategy.
